Dear hiring manager of Pelmorex
It is my great pleasure to apply for the Computer Science Co-op role with Pelmorex as posted internally by the Ryerson Co-op Office. As a 3rd-year Computer Science Co-op student at Ryerson University who is passionate about analyzing problems, learning, and analyzing malware for cybersecurity issues, this opportunity caught my attention. With my proven academic excellence and certificate, I am confident that my familiarity with Cybersecurity, Scripting, and Penetration testing knowledge would qualify me as a competitive candidate for this position.
Pelmorex's requirement aligns with my passion for computer security. Directly related to the requirements of this role, my main studies focus deeply on ethical hacking and prepared me well to do penetration testing. To prove this matter, when I was doing my QA Analyst Co-op with theScore, I express passion for cyber security and get approval on trying to hack through theScore’s Android app. I successfully find a way to break down the app’s SSL Pinning Certificate feature by reverse engineering the *.apk file and documenting everything. Impress by my work, they give me a higher ground to try and hack through their web application. The web app is more secure, probably because web vulnerabilities are updated every day, so I didn’t find any way to hack through. It is still a very good experience. As a co-op student with PelmorexCorp, I would love to contribute similar results in terms of protecting clients and implementing safety measures to fight against data breaches and system severity.
Thank you for your time and consideration. With the details listed above that I can bring to Pelmorex Corp, I have the commitment and a strong passion for security to succeed as a Co-op student. I would appreciate the chance to meet with you to speak more about this opportunity.
Sincerely,
Phuc Hua
